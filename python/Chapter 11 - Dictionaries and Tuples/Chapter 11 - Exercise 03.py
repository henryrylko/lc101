#  Write a program that will function as a grade book, allowing a user (a
#  professor or teacher) to enter the class roster for a course, along with
#  each studentâ€™s cumulative grade. It then prints the class roster along with
#  the average cumulative grade. Grades are on a 0-100 percentage scale. Use 2
#  lists (grades and students) and the enumerate function in your solution.
#
#  Implement the functionality of the above program using a dictionary instead
#  of a list.
#
#  A test run of this program would yield the following:
#
#  # this is the first batch of input the user would enter
#  Chris
#  Jesse
#  Sally
#
#  # this is the second batch of input the user would enter
#  Grade for Chris: 90
#  Grade for Jesse: 80
#  Grade for Sally: 70
#
#  # below is what your program should output
#  Class roster:
#  Chris (90.0)
#  Jesse (80.0)
#  Sally (70.0)
#
#  Average grade: 80.0
