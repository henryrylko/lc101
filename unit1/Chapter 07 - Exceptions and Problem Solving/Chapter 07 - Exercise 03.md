Solve the following non-coding problem to practice your problem solving skills.

You have a job in the quality control department at a ball factory. A coworker
left behind 10 boxes of balls. You know that each normal ball weighs 10g, and
each defective ball weighs 9g. There are nine boxes consisting of only normal
balls, and one box of only defective balls.

You have a digital scale and can take only one measurement. How can you
determine which box contains the defective balls?


Answer:

Label the boxes from 1 - 10.  Take 1 ball from box 1, 2 balls from box 2, 3 balls
from box 3, etc., all the way up to 10 balls from box 10.  Put these 55 balls on
the scale and weigh them.  If the balls were all normal, they would weigh 550g.
However, since defective balls weigh 1g less than normal balls, the difference
between 550 and the total weight of the balls will represent number of defective
balls being weighed.  This will be a number between 1 and 10 inclusive and this
will also be the box number of the defective balls.
