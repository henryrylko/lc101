Solve the following non-coding problem to practice your problem solving skills.

You have three boxes that contain some combination of apples and oranges:

*  One has only apples
*  One has only oranges
*  One has both apples and oranges

The boxes have labels signifying each of the three, but *each box is
mislabeled*.

You may ask for one item from one of the boxes to be shown to you. This item
will be randomly pulled from the box.

How can you figure out the correct labeling of the boxes?


Answer:

Ask for an item from the box mislabeled "Apples and Oranges".
If you get an Apple, then since this box is mislabeled, it contains only apples.
Likewise, if you get an Orange, then this box contains only oranges.

If the item you receive is an apple, then the box that is mislabeled as "Oranges" cannot be the "Oranges" box and it cannot be the "Apples" box because you have already determined that the "Apples" was the one mislabeled as "Apples and Oranges" above.  Therefore, the box mislabeled as "Oranges" must be the "Apples and Oranges" box.  Now having identified two of the three boxes, only one choice remains for the third.

Corresponding logic applies if the item you receive is an orange instead of an apple.  Just swap the words apple and orange in the paragraph above.
