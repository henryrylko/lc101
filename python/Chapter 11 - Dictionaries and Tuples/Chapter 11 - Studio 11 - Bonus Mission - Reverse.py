#  Create a function reverse that takes in a dictionary and reverses it, such
#  that all of the values become keys and all of the keys become values. Be
#  careful: we do not wish to lose any information. Consider what to do if the
#  original dictionary has lists of values for a particular key, or has
#  duplicate values for some keys.

#  I chose not to complete this Bonus Mission because I thought that the
#  requirements were vague (at best).  In general, I don't believe that
#  dictionaries are reversible, since keys must be immutable, but values can
#  have any type.  While it may be possible to handle the case of values which
#  are lists of immutable values, I think it would be too kludgy to try to
#  constrain the dictionary to these special cases.
