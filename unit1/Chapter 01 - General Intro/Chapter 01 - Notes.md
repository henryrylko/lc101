# Chapter 1 of LC101 version of Think Python:  General Intro



##  The Way of the Program

The most important skill associated with programming is **problem solving**.


##  Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a step by step list of instructions, which if followed will solve the problem under consideration.


##  The Python Programming Language

Python is a **high-level language**.

Machine code and assembly are examples of **low-level languages**.

Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: **interpreters** and **compilers**.

An interpreter processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.

A compiler reads and translates the program completely before the execution starts.  Once a program is compiled into object code, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.

By convention, files that contain Python programs have names that end with .py.


##  Executing Python in this Book

There are two tools used: **activecode** and **codelens**.  Codelens can be used to trace code.


##  More about Programs

A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.

Five capabilities of most programming languages are:  **input**, **output**, **math and logic**, **conditional execution** and **repetition**.

Programming can be described as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with sequences of these basic capabilities.


##  A Typical First Program
```
print("Hello, World!")
```

##  Comments

A **comment** in a computer program is text that is intended only for the human reader - it is completely ignored by the interpreter.  In Python, the `#` token starts a comment.  The rest of the line is ignored.
